12.3.3 FLOW CONTROL
Distributed systems encompass a lot of data flow from one site to another and also within a site. 
Flow control prevents data from being transferred in such a way that it can be accessed by unauthorized agents. 
A flow policy lists out the channels through which information can flow. 
It also defines security classes for data as well as transactions. 
Prevents information from flowing in such a way that it reaches unauthorized users. 
Suitable for database over multiuser system or network.

Flow control checks that information contained in some data objects does 
not flow (explicitly or implicitly) into less protected objects.

• A clearance for a security class can be assigned to each application 
program.
• Like a DB user, each application program is subjected to the same 
read/write restrictions. 


12.3.4 DATA ENCRYPTION
Suppose we communicate data, but our data falls into the hands of a 
nonlegitimate user. In this situation, by using encryption we can disguise 
the message so that even if the transmission is diverted, the message will 
not be revealed. 

Database encryption is the process of converting data, within 
a database, in plain text format into a meaningless cipher text by means of 
a suitable algorithm.

Database decryption is converting the meaningless cipher text into the 
original information using keys generated by the encryption algorithms.

It enhances security and privacy when access controls are bypassed, 
because in cases of data loss or theft, encrypted data cannot be easily 
understood by unauthorized persons.
